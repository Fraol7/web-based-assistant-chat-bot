The  Web-based  Cybersecurity  Assistance  Chatbot  project  aims  to  address  this  demand  by 
developing  a  menu-based  chatbot  that  provides  users  with  cybersecurity  guidance  and  support. 
The chatbot is designed to assist users in understanding and addressing security issues they may 
encounter  while  using  digital  platforms  and  services.  By  offering  a  user-friendly  interface  and 
relevant information, the chatbot aims to empower users with the knowledge and tools necessary 
to enhance their cybersecurity practices.


The  project  focuses  on  providing  practical  recommendations  and  best  practices  related  to 
cybersecurity.  It  covers  various  topics,  including  identifying  phishing  emails,  generating  strong 
passwords,  removing  malware,  and  recognizing  common  cyber  threats  and  scams.  By  offering 
comprehensive  assistance  in  these  areas,  the  chatbot  serves  as  a  reliable  resource  for  users  of 
diverse backgrounds and expertise levels in which almost all of cyber-attacks are related to lack 
of awareness of users in using various systems.
